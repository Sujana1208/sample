<center>
After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?”

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then Sophia replied;<br />
<center>
 “When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.”
